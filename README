This is a simple Java program to model the behaviour of a RepRap hot end (or 
anything else that gets heated) to allow the parameters of a PID for controlling
it to be set.

The Hot End is modelled as follows:

  dT/dt = a*p + b*(T - T0)    ----- (1)
  
  t is time in seconds
  T is temperature in C
  p is the dimensionless input power.
  T0 is room temperature
  a and b are parameters that get set experimentally (see below).
  
For constant p, ODE (1) has the solution:
 
  T = T0 + a*p*[1 - e^(b(tLag - t))]/b  -----(2)
  
where tLag is the time between applying power and any change in temperature occurring.
  
p is changed to a PWM value in [0, range] internally.  

Generally, the unknown values are a, b and tLag.

So the procedure is to fix a value of p, run the hot end up from
cold using it, and record the temperatures every dt seconds into
a data file.

This program then reads that data file (the first temperature in which is taken to be T0)
and compares it with Equation (2).  Arbitrary, but sensible, values of a, b and tLag are set
for the initial comparison.  The program works out a residual sum of squares for the errors, 
then iterates to find the values of a, b and tLag that minimise that RSS.  The iteration 
computes numerical values for the partial derivatives of the RSS with respect to a, b and tLag
then uses a downhill pathfinder to get to a minimum RSS.
